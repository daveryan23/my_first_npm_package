# My first published package

This is my first published package on npm!!!

To use this package, require it to a variable **X**.

Then use **X.hiThereYou(yourName)** to obtain a useful greeting.

There is an alternative greeting at **X.helloYou(yourName)**.

These are the only two things currently in the export. I hope you like it.
