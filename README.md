# My first published package

This is my first published package on npm!!!

To use this package, require it to a variable, for example **xyz**.

Then use **xyz.hiThereYou(yourName)** to obtain a useful greeting.

There is an alternative greeting at **xyz.helloYou(yourName)**.

These are the only two things currently in the export. I hope you like it.
